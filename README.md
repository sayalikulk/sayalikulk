# Hi, I’m Sayali Kulkarni 👋

M.S. Electrical & Computer Engineering @ UW–Madison (Dec 2026)  
Interested in **Design Verification / CPU Verification** and **Computer Architecture**.

- 🔭 Building: **RISC-V 5-stage pipelined CPU + I/D caches** (SystemVerilog)
- 🧪 Enjoy: waveform debug (Questa/ModelSim), self-checking testbenches, regressions
- 🧠 Focus: pipeline hazards (stall/flush/forwarding), caches, memory hierarchy
- 🧰 Also: Linux + OS internals (fork/exec/wait, pipes/dup2), C/C++, Python

---

## Skills
**HDL/Verification:** SystemVerilog, Verilog, self-checking testbenches, scoreboarding, directed + randomized testing, SVA (basic), functional coverage (basic), regression/seed-based debug  
**Software:** C/C++, Python, Bash, Java, SQL, R  
**Tools:** Linux, Git, GDB, Valgrind, Make, Jenkins, Docker, Quartus, Synopsys Design Compiler

## Highlight Projects
### RISC-V 5-Stage Pipelined Processor + Caches (SystemVerilog)
- Implemented RV32I 5-stage pipeline with hazard detection, forwarding, stall/flush control  
- Integrated I-Cache/D-Cache with hit/miss control and memory interface timing  
- Verified with directed + randomized tests; debugged via ModelSim/Questa waveforms

### Custom Unix Shell (C / POSIX)
- Built shell supporting fork/exec/wait, PATH resolution, built-ins  
- Implemented pipelines via `pipe()` + `dup2()` and I/O redirection  
- Memory-safe implementation validated with Valgrind

### FPGA Segway Controller (SystemVerilog)
- PID control + SPI sensor interface + PWM motor drive  
- Self-checking SV testbenches; synthesized using Design Compiler

## Experience
**JP Morgan Chase — Software Engineer II (C++/Java/Python/Linux)**  
Production debugging, backend services at scale, data validation/migrations

**UW–Madison OSPO — Open Source Software Intern (R/C++)**  
Unifying spike-and-slab LASSO implementations into a single R package backed by C++
